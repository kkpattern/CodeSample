These code solves problems in TopCoder algorithm competition SRM 576DIV2.
This is my first SRM room win in TopCoder. These code is not writen in Python
but C++. But I think it shows that I am capable to write correct code under
time pressure.
I added the statement of each problem at the beginning of the source code.
