microspider is a library for crawling data on Sina Weibo(Chinese biggest
twitter-like website).

Weibo provides RESTful API for applications to fetch data. To make a request
one needs a valid access token. Also every access token has a limited number
of requests it can make per hour.

This library is organized as follows:
- microspider.api: This module implements the http request to Weibo API.
- microspider.robot: This module manages the robots. A robot is an user account
    with an access token for making API requests. Managing the robots means you
    can save a access token through a RobotManager and get the access token
    later for API request without worrying exceed the limit.
- microspider.fetcher: This module contains helper functors for users to fetch
    data from Weibo without using microspider.robot and microspider.api
    themselves.
- microspider.urllibx: This module provides extensions for urllib and urllib2.
    For now the only "important" class in this module is URLOpener. It provides
    an easy way to do http get/post request.
